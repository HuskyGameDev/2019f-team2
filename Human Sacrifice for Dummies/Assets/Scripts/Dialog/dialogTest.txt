Use the mouse to hit the buttons on the left side of the screen.
Each turn is compromised by one movement for the necromancer, one movement for the sacrifice, and one attack by the necromancer.
You can move the necromancer and sacrifice by pressing the buttons labeled "Move Necro" and "Move Sac."
The necromancer and sacrifice can move 3 spaces at a time.
Press "End Turn" to end turn. Enemies will have a turn after player finished turn.
Once the enemy turn ends, it will be the player's turn again.
The goal is to get to get the sacrafice to the alter without either the sacrafice or the necromancer dying.
