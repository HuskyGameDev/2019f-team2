Use the mouse to hit the buttons on the left side of the screen. If you need to go back, press the left arrow key.
Each turn is compromised by one movement for the necromancer, one movement for the sacrifice, and one attack by the necromancer in any order.
You can move the necromancer and sacrifice by pressing the buttons labeled "Move Necro" and "Move Sac."
The necromancer and sacrifice can move 3 spaces at a time by default.
Press "End Turn" to end turn. Enemies will have a turn after you finish your turn.
Once the enemy turn ends, it will be the your turn again.
The goal is to get to get the sacrafice to the alter without either the sacrifice or the necromancer dying.
